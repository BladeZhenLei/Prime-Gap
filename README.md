## 2-tuple
### 1. Polignac's Conjecture
All elements in the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, ...} can be expressed as difference of infinitely many consecutive primes. In other words, there exist infinitely many 2-tuple $(0,k)$ where $k$ takes all even numbers.

None.

### 2. Twin Prime Conjecture (sub-problem of 1)
The unique adimissible 2-tuple $(0,2)$ as difference of primes are infinitely many, in other words, there exist infinitely many consectutive two primes in the pattern $(p, p+2)$. 
<p/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
The closest result is from Yitang Zhang (2013) where he showed at least one 2-tuple which matches infinitely many positions; subsequent work showed that some 2-tuple exists with values differing by 246 or less that matches infinitely many positions.
